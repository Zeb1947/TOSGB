                The site TOSGB™ (The Old School GuideBook™) is a open source free tool for retro tech enthusiasts.<br>
                It's main goal is to basically become the next wikipedia, but of course much smaller and only for retro based things.<br><br>
            </div>

            <div>
                TOSGB™ is made entirely by Dean Brosnan, formal developer name often Hikari [光]. I spend my free time making small or big projects just like this.<br>
                My github, youtube, and gamejolt are available on the home page <a href="../#social">here</a> <b>[social accounts]</b>.<br>
                I have many other sites, eventually I will develop a portfolio site <a>here</a> <b>[portfolio page]</b>. If the link does not work this means I have not finished or started developing a portfolio site.<br>
